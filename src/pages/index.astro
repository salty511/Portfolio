  <p>
    I’ve recently graduated with a 2-1 Mphys in Astrophysics and am looking for work in software dev, data science, modelling and ML/AI methods. 
    I’m currently living back home in Brighton but am willing to relocate. 
    During my course I’ve developed strong programming skills, working mainly in Python for data science/modelling applications. 
    See some project examples above.
